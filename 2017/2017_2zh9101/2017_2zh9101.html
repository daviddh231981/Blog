        <h2>Shenzhen Airlines's First A330! Shenzhen to Beijing</h2>
        <p>
        Quick photo report of Shenzhen Airlines's first A330-300, which they got a few months ago and are flying domestically.

        <img src="IMG_4110.JPG" alt="View of the wing." height="3456" width="4608">
        Wing view from 18K wasn't too bad. 
        </p>

        <img src="IMG_4114.JPG" alt="Newspaper article talking about their second A330, they just received it the day before today!" height="3456" width="4608">
        Here's the newspaper article talking about their second A330 that they just received the day before my flight.

        Paper cups... at least there was branding?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4134.JPG" alt="Entertainment screen" height="3456" width="4608">
        Entertainment screen was also quite new. 
        </p>

        <img src="IMG_4138.JPG" alt="Meal Tray" height="3456" width="4608">
        Shenzhen Airlines is allegedly a Low-Cost Carrier. Well it feels like they aren't because a full meal was served. It was
        good, though my expectations were low. Noodles were the entree.</p>

        <img src="IMG_4154.JPG" alt="View of the wing with spoilers deployed." height="3456" width="4608">
        Spoilers deployed to slow down before landing. 
        </p>

        <img src="IMG_4171.JPG" alt="B-8865 at Beijing." height="3456" width="4608">
        Here's a picture of the plane at Beijing. The registration was B-8865. I think the ZH livery on the A330 looks nice. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        A nice flight with Shenzhen Airlines. I would not hesitate to take this flight again if it fit my schedule.
