        <h2>China Southern A321 Beijing to Guangzhou</h2>
        <p>
        Quick photo report of a China Southern A321 domestically. It's the earliest flight out of there as far
        as I'm aware, seeing it departs right around 6:30. Not helpful if you're far from the airport.
        </p>

        B-6553 will fly CZ3166 today. It's in the Skyteam livery. So that's a bonus to the flight today. 
        </p>

        Channels with audio. I guess I wanted to sleep for the flight today, so it didn't matter?

        Legroom was acceptable, it was only 3 hours, and it's an A321. Though I planned to sleep.

        Otherwise it's a dropdown TV with their programming of whatever it is. I just preferred sleeping and reading my book.

        A meal was served. Both options were rice, but one's chicken and the other's beef. It came with bread, ham and veggie combo, 
        and some other things I couldn't tell. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4309.JPG" alt="Chicken and rice" height="3456" width="4608">
        I had the chicken and rice, which was nice. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4310.JPG" alt="Beef and rice" height="4608" width="3456">
        Here is the beef option.

        <img src="IMG_4311.JPG" alt="Coke with ice" height="3456" width="4608">
        Since it's lunch that was being served, I had a coke with ice. 
        </p>

        It's daytime though, and I could actually hear the IAE V2500 engines hum. 
        </p>

        It's early, so I would likely find a place near the airport to spend the night before the flight. The terminal is empty and calmer 
        around this time too. I would not hesitate to take this flight again if it fit my schedule.
