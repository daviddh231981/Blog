        <h2>United Club B18, Chicago O'Hare</h2>

        After arriving from an earlier flight, I went all the way from Concourse F to the end of Concourse B. Well, 
        initially I went to the one near C16 (crossing the tunnel). But that was packed and there was apparently no 
        “breakfast”, so I went to the one near B18.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3679.JPG" alt="Entrance to the lounge" height="3024" width="4032">
        The entrance kind of sets high standards. Don’t go in there expecting a four-course meal. Go to the Polaris 
        Lounge for that (or eat a hot dog, that’s what I missed). Past these doors, there’s a lounge attendant. 
        They’ll check your credentials and scan your boarding pass. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3709.JPG" alt="Seating front" height="3024" width="4032">
        Seating was so-so. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3710.JPG" alt="Seating back" height="3024" width="4032">
        There’s also a back section. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3703.JPG" alt="Power" height="4032" width="3024">
        All come with power outlets and usually include USB ports. Though only one in my block worked. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3680.JPG" alt="Fruits, silverware, and plates" height="3024" width="4032">
        Fruits, silverware, and plates. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3681.JPG" alt="Hot breakfast" height="3024" width="4032">
        Decent pork or turkey sausages and eggs, heated, which kind of surpassed my expectations, not lying. I 
        think there were condiments as well (ketchup, anyone?). 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3682.JPG" alt="Breads/Sweets/what?" height="3024" width="4032">
        Bunch of breads that were quite ok. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3721.JPG" alt="Expresso machine" height="3024" width="4032">
        <img src="IMG_3723.JPG" alt="Expresso machine" height="3024" width="4032">
        Expresso-based drinks were also available… 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3705.JPG" alt="Coffee and decaf" height="3024" width="4032">
        As well as regular coffee and decaf. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3708.JPG" alt="Bar" height="3024" width="4032">
        A bar if you want. I think it opens at 10:30, but I'm not for sure. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3694.JPG" alt="FIDS Screens" height="3024" width="4032">
        And flight information screen for flight information. I had a six-hour layover, so my flight didn’t show up yet. 
        When I was there, the only flight that was actually “called out” was an ANA flight to Tokyo, and it was someone 
        walking around with a sign, so I’d have a notification set on my phone or something. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3686.JPG" alt="Coke machine" height="3024" width="4032">
        Soda machine (I may have had some drinks from there). And some other breads and condiments (standard). Wouldn’t 
        touch them though. It seems that they’re farther away than the main buffet and I don’t know why they’d put it 
        with the drinks. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        For lunch, the food was switched at around 11:00. I believe these stays until the lounge closes. Also, around the 
        time I decided to put the soda machine to good use and get a drink from it. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3713.JPG" alt="Hot lunch" height="3024" width="4032">
        For the hot food, there was some noodle and rice stir fry or something? 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3714.JPG" alt="Salad" height="3024" width="4032">
        A salad bar (which I appreciated; I needed some veggies).
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3715.JPG" alt="Brownie and soup" height="3024" width="4032">
        Brownies, and soup of the day was cheddar broccoli. Crackers were avaialble too. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Did I mention the WiFi was fast? I didn’t measure it, but I used Instagram and Snapchat, which went really fast. I 
        also had to download a few .pdf files, which also were very fast. So internet is not a problem at the United Club.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_5206.JPG" alt="Cookie and drink" height="4032" width="3024">
        There were also cookies and other snacks (I think trail mix). Picture from my return trip, but the same cookie and trail mix selection was available. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3712.JPG" alt="Frosted window" height="4032" width="3024">
        Sum it up in a sentence: unless you want tarmac views, this is a decent lounge per U.S. standards. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_3726.JPG" alt="" height="3024" width="4032">
        Or for the old planes. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Photos were from my iPhone 6S. I couldn’t discreetly photograph the club with my camera, so I had no option.
