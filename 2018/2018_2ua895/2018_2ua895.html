      <h2>United Airlines Boeing 777-200ER Chicago to Hong Kong and Back, Summer 2018 </h2>
      <p>
      <img src="IMG_3674.JPG" alt="Crossing the tunnel." height="1920" width="3412">
      It was a trip to the other side of the tunnel after a visit/stay at the United Club. 
      That’s ok because the tunnel was nice. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <img src="IMG_3728.JPG" alt="N228UA towed in to fly UA895." height="3024" width="4032">
      The plane was towed in quite late at probably twenty minutes before boarding (hah). Which made flight attendants happy 
      (frankly everyone). Aircraft tail was N228UA, nose #2828, a stalker because I flew this plane the reverse route last winter.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <img src="IMG_3730.JPG" alt="Boarding feedback screen." height="4032" width="3024">
      Boarding was definitely late by probably half an hour, so that was extra time spent in Group 2. Not funny. With a new boarding 
      method that I didn’t understand with this particular gate, but at least people weren’t lining up everywhere or crowding at the 
      gate. No feedback was given. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <img src="IMG_3732.JPG" alt="Seats were provided with pillow and blanket." height="3024" width="4032">

      <img src="IMG_5240.PNG" alt="Screenshot from the return flight with same seats." height="750" width="1334">
      Old cabin. Some screenshots from my video, and definitely some pictures of my seat. With a blanket and pillow already positioned. 
      Some pictures were from my return flight, but the seats are the same. Width of the 3-3-3 seats was 18.1 inches.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <img src="IMG_3734.JPG" alt="Pitch." height="3024" width="4032">
      <img src="IMG_3735.JPG" alt="With fist as reference." height="3024" width="4032">
      Pitch was 31 inches (though I don’t have a measurement), here’s my fist showing my initial sitting position, but definitely not 
      halfway through the flight. Selecting 31” instead of 32” prescribed by Boeing for the similar configuration with lavatories in the 
      back (minus the center section). It’s page 25 of this document 
      <a href="https://www.boeing.com/resources/boeingdotcom/commercial/airports/acaps/777_23.pdf">link</a>. If you haven’t realized by now,
      I’m saying how I don’t understand why you wouldn’t go with 32” when you can’t really cram another row in by removing an inch from each 
      seat.

      <img src="IMG_3741.JPG" alt="UA881 to NRT." height="3024" width="4032">
      Here’s the view, by the way, with a sistership to Tokyo Narita (N225UA, nose #2025 operating UA881). UA881 departs before UA895, 
      but definitely not too much earlier thanks to the delay we just took.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <img src="DSC01644.JPG" alt="N660UA towed to C20." height="2760" width="4912">
      Now, we got another plane getting towed in (Boeing 767-322ER, tail N660UA nose #6460) for a flight to London/LHR, 
      taking the spot that was just vacated with the Boeing 777 to Tokyo – Narita, gate C20. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <img src="IMG_3743.JPG" alt="Paper secures lavatory (not really)." height="3024" width="4032">
      By the way, this is how they secure the lavatories for departure (me guessing it’s so that it’s easier for the flight 
      attendants to unlock the door from the outside). 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <img src="IMG_3747.JPG" alt="Gas truck/cart." height="4032" width="3024">
      This coming before we just took another delay with what the Captain described as “refueling and paperwork”. At least this flight no 
      longer continues to Singapore, maybe? So I’ll be making some more calls I guess? Oh, it was a rolling delay, but only by 10 minutes, 
      and it wasn’t even that bad, being a total of 23 minutes. We should make some of that up. <i>By the way, this is a fuel truck just below 
      the flap track fairing (the pod/pylon thingy). </i>

      <p>
      <img src="IMG_3752.JPG" alt="Drink and snack." height="3024" width="4032">
      There’s a drinks and pretzel service before the meal.

      Meal had two choices, pasta or chicken with fried rice. I had the latter, so did my seatmates. Served on a plastic blue tray.

      I had Ginger Ale to drink, full can with cup of ice was given. This is the new standard for meals? Because I don’t recall the 
      last time, I got the full can with any drink service before today.

      <p>
      <img src="DSC01663.JPG" alt="Screen with bar...?" height="2760" width="4912">
      Here’s the screen, I just choose a random movie. I don’t know if the bar actually works or not, I just thought of it now. 
      At least they’re going away, but there’s a caveat with the seats. 
      </p>

      <img src="IMG_3763.JPG" alt="Pen and AVOD screen. Pen wins, kind of." height="3024" width="4032">
      Here is a pen to measure the screen. The pen is not very long, probably around an inch shorter than the #2 pencil. Not good.

      <img src="DSC01682.JPG" alt="Safety card for the 77_." height="2760" width="4912">
      Safety card works for the many subfleets of this particular plane in this particular configuration, as while there are the same 
      number of seats with the same type of seats, there’s certain differences between the three with crew rests, at least that is my 
      understanding.

      We all had breakfast for dinner. Just say it’s fun for now. Choice of pancakes or eggs “skillet” and comes with pineapple and grapes. 
      And eating with my fingers because silverware (plasticware) was missing on my tray… yes, yes, I sanitized my hands first with hand 
      sanitizer. Always bring some.

      Food was ok. Flavor for the entrée of the first meal was quite spicy! Seats were definitely old, worn out, and they are definitely slimline! 
      But the question is whether you want a 3-3-3 config with old seats, AVOD screen that doesn’t work, hard seats (Zodiac 5751 is quite hard when 
      used since 2010) and wide aisles. Or whether you want a 3-4-3 config with new seats that are designed to cradle 
      (<a href="https://paxex.aero/united-airlines-aspire-economy-class-rockwell-collins/">link</a>), new AVOD screen that’s much more responsive, 
      and 1 less inch of recline. Service was enough for me on this flight (full can!). Finally, I don’t care about the AVOD screen because they’re 
      going away. But the screens are really bad, I used my phone.

      For the return flight in August, I had aircraft N799UA nose #2799. The same flight attendant from my December 2017 flight was onboard serving

      I took the Airport Express to the airport, which features a free shuttle bus from the hotel to the airport and check-in at the subway station 
      (which has a terrible catchment area minus the buses). This is in addition to the better seats on trains. This isn’t considered checking in at 
      the airport, so if you’re flagged, you have to go to the airport with your bags.
