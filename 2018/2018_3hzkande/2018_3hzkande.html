      I got to the hotel past 10 at night… and a long flight… makes anyone tired. But there are still 
      entrance pics to the hotel, which was… impressive enough.

      Check–in as usual plus extreme document-checking. Then it was to the elevators. No, the stairs 
      were for the second floor, not the only access to elevators...

      And to a room that was most definitely filled with cigarette smell. So, someone was definitely 
      smoking here, because this was a smoking room. The fact that this was a smoking room, I didn’t know 
      until after I checked in, and there wasn’t a non-smoking room available because both floors (!) were 
      sold out. Un-freaking-believable. I'll have more of this issue at the end.

      Here’s the sole bed (I recall reserving a double…?) and closet (standalone on legs, looks like I 
      could move it if I wanted to, really?).

      I guess the bathtub is a nice place to relax after a long day. It came with a plastic cover.

      So by 4:30 in the morning, I called housekeeping to complain about the smoke-filled room, and they 
      provided me with this "air filter" that not only did little to help, but required the door to the 
      hallway be open. I don't fault the lady who brought the air filter here, as she said this is all she
      had (of course she got a generous tip from me, being this was too early in the morning and kind of 
      an outrageous request with a smoking room… of course she tried to decline, of course I didn't let her
      give it back to me). <i>Instead, I fault the management, and management only, because they clearly
      didn't have their heads straight with this issue</i>

      Pool was… for recreational only, not for exercise unless you can figure out how lap swim here works.

      And an outside shower, completely visible to the public without any type of wall or partition. No 
      meaning intended, just showing a picture of the shower. I'd just use this to rinse off, but the one

      This is where things get interesting. Ramp was… for what? It was to the “back” of the pool, too. It 
      was easily accessible; how would I not have been able to get this picture if there wasn’t any sort of 
      wall, barrier, or any sign saying not to go there? You’d think they’d have some type of barrier 
      separating the ramp after construction… maybe?

      Exiting the pool area to the exercise room, it appeared to be manned, with this “feet pool” that I

      Now the positives. We must give credit where credit is due. This hotel is not the worst place to be 
      at for a night’s stay. The breakfast selection was mostly Chinese, and a lot of people seemed to 
      enjoy it. The pool and exercise room are good enough for me. Finally, the rooms had the amenities I 
      expected, and surpassed my expectation with the bathtub. If you want to do a “staycation” here for no 
      more than a week, then this is a decent place to be at, but with a massive caveat…
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The big negative was about the smoke-filled room. Not everyone smokes, and not the majority smokes. I 
      called the front desk for a different room, but I was told that <i>both</i> floors of non-smoking 
      rooms were full… out of the 12… something, probably more. Seriously??? I know that there's quite a 
      few people who smoke, <i>but definitely not enough to warrant every floor except a few be marked as 
      smoking!</i> 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Unfortunately for me, the smoke-filled room  was enough to negate all of the positives in this hotel, 
      and I will certainly book away from this location, knowing that there are plenty of other good places 
      to stay. Sad that an <i>International</i> hotel (the name of this hotel) doesn't know how to
      distribute the number of rooms correctly, and doesn't bother figuring out a way to deal with this 
      issue. When checking out at the front desk, I asked them about this issue and told them I got caught 
      up with it, but they couldn't have been more indifferent about this and clearly showed that they were 
      fine with it.
