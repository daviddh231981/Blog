        <h2>Air China Boeing 787-9 Beijing to Guangzhou and Bonus</h2>
        
        <p>
        <img src="DSC02231.JPG" alt="CA1351" height="2760" width="4912">
        This was a flight from Beijing to Guangzhou that I took in the middle of the trip. Originally, on 
        the reverse, I was going to take a Boeing 787-9, but that flight was delayed so that I’d be out of 
        Guangzhou after the time I was supposed to be in Beijing, so I rebooked. This is why I booked this 
        early morning flight, but it would also put me in Guangzhou on time for a train ride. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Check-in was chaotic, there was no way I could take pictures without getting swept the wrong way.
        So there aren’t pictures. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4739.JPG" alt="Train" height="3024" width="4032">
        <img src="IMG_4740.JPG" alt="Inside" height="3024" width="4032">
        The flight departed from T3D, so I had to take the train. By the way, the train was before clearing 
        security, and the train also goes to the international departures area (T3E). All I had to do was 
        scan my boarding pass, and I was let into the area to board the train. Now I’m hoping that there’s 
        no gate change, because I don’t seem to find a way to be able to use the reverse. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I think there were only one or two flights out of T3D, including mine, within the hour. Security
        was too fast, but I got pulled aside for a secondary search. Even with that, security was still 
        quick (probably around 5 minutes, and this was with the secondary search). Pick whichever line you want; there’s a ton of them for the few passengers that just got off 
        the train! 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="DSC02224.JPG" alt="B-1591 will fly to Guangzhou" height="2760" width="4912">
        There’s my plane! B-1591 will operate CA1351 to Guangzhou this morning. Though there’s another thing…
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4742.JPG" alt="Boeing 747-8i to Guangzhou, but later in the day" height="3024" width="4032">
        Air China operates a Boeing 747-8i daily or twice daily on this route, with a departure around 
        noon. I would’ve picked this flight had I not needed to be in Hong Kong by the evening (taking a 
        train, might I add). Darn. Oh well. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4743.JPG" alt="My plane with gate area." height="3024" width="4032">
        This is my iPhone picture of my plane, which wasn’t the best, but I kind of wanted the gate area 
        picture. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4820.PNG" alt="3-3-3" height="750" width="1334">
        <img src="IMG_4754.JPG" alt="Economy" height="3024" width="4032">
        Boarding was quick but I kind of missed the boarding announcement. Air China, like pretty much 
        everyone else on the Boeing 787, uses a 3-3-3 configuration. Which is comfortable on the 777, but a 
        little tight on the 787. Though it didn’t matter for this flight, I wonder how it would feel for a 
        seven-hour flight to Singapore. 
        </p>

        <img src="IMG_4756.JPG" alt="View from the back to the forward economy cabin" height="3024" width="4032">
        View from the back into the forward economy cabin. A problem occurred here where I had to wade an 
        oncoming wave of people because I went to the back cabin for a quick pic before people were seated. 
        That’s on me. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4803.JPG" alt="View from the back, darkened" height="3024" width="4032">
        <img src="IMG_4804.JPG" alt="View from the back, darkened" height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s a darkened cabin from the very back.
        </p>
        
        <p>

        <img src="IMG_4810.JPG" alt="View from the back, pre-arrival with mood lighting on." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the view just prior to arrival, with mood lighting. This is where I am led to believe the 
        seats are provided by Zodiac and are the Z300 seats. 
        </p>

        <img src="IMG_4757.JPG" alt="no overhead bins for last few rows" height="3024" width="4032">
        <img src="IMG_4806.JPG" alt="No overhead bins for last few rows" height="3024" width="4032">
        Be advised that the last few rows, there aren’t overhead bins available because it’s either for 
        emergency equipment (in the case of the starboard side) or the crew rest (in the case of the 
        middle). The overhead bins elsewhere are large, though. I could fit my rollaboard vertically, and I 
        think you could fit four or five in each of these bins. 
        </p>

        <p>
        <img src="DSC02226.JPG" alt="legroom" height="2760" width="4912">
        You’ll probably see about an inch or two from my knees to the seat in front. I’m not a very tall 
        person. You’ll also see the power outlet, which is the green light to my left knee. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="DSC02227.JPG" alt="no overhead vents" height="2760" width="4912">
        Something increasingly unpopular with me is the lack of overhead vents. I don’t care too much if 
        the flight isn’t too long and the cabin is kept cooler, but this is a plane used for some longer 
        international flights.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4760.JPG" alt="massive windows" height="3024" width="4032">
        Planes these days… got these massive windows. Not that I’m arguing, of course! 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4763.JPG" alt="safety card" height="3024" width="4032">
        Safety card is standard. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4779.JPG" alt="red" height="3024" width="4032">
        Mood lighting is always appreciated, when used correctly (including on at boarding and completely
        dark (i.e. lights off), the former not being true with this flight). 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4771.JPG" alt="flex" height="4032" width="3024">
        The whole reason why I wanted a seat over the wing was to watch the wing flex, which is always 
        interesting. I tried to get some footage, but it ended up being the camera getting tossed around. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="DSC02225.JPG" alt="IFE at boarding" height="2760" width="4912">
        Here’s the IFE screen at boarding.

        <p>
        <img src="DSC02230.JPG" alt="language options" height="2760" width="4912">
        After taking off, I found that there were three language options.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="DSC02234.JPG" alt="map" height="2760" width="4912">
        The map was of the latest version, interactive. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="DSC02235.JPG" alt="IFE entertainment stuff" height="2760" width="4912">
        And here were some entertainment options. I didn’t count, but I had a book I was reading, so I did 
        that instead.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="DSC02237.JPG" alt="Drink 1" height="2760" width="4912">
        First round of drinks, and I found that this table was two-fold. Anyways, is it too early for a coke
        with ice?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4784.JPG" alt="breakfast tray" height="3024" width="4032">
        They do serve breakfast on this flight. Options for the entrée were congee or omelet. Carbs or 
        protein. I choose protein. This is served with bread, jam, yogurt, and two slices of fruit (half a 
        peach and one slice of pineapple). 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4786.JPG" alt="croissant" height="4032" width="3024">
        The bread was a croissant with jam. It was flaky, though it was a little colder because it was 
        packaged. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4788.JPG" alt="omelet" height="3024" width="4032">
        Here is the omelet option. It was quite bland, and no salt (at least any salt packets) was to be 
        seen. Everything minus the tomato was dry. Though I still appreciate being served breakfast at 9:00 
        (around the time of both Beijing and Guangzhou when we got food). 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4797.JPG" alt="wing flex with turbulence" height="3024" width="4032">
        The wing flex is amazing, as always. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4798.JPG" alt="bathroom" height="3024" width="4032">
        I visited the bathroom about 40 minutes prior to landing. It was quite clean. And I ignored the 
        “return to seat” indicator because it’s always on. On a flight two years ago, on a Boeing 777-200 
        to Shenzhen, I asked a flight attendant why the sign always stays on. He said it’s because they 
        want to remind people to keep their seatbelts fastened at all times while seated, even without 
        turbulence. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4809.JPG" alt="walking back" height="3024" width="4032">
        By the time I started walking back to my seat, the cabin lights were being turned on, starting with 
        mood lighting.

        To get to Beijing, I flew the reverse on an Airbus A330-300 (which was a repositioning flight, 
        because of delays during the 2-day period). 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <img src="IMG_4158.JPG" alt="cups" height="3024" width="4032">
        I had grape juice to start. The A330-300 seats come with a cup holder.

        <img src="IMG_4151.JPG" alt="old entertainment screen" height="3024" width="4032">
        The entertainment screen was definitely older generation, with a harder touch required…

        The A330-300 flight was not part of this post, so there are no comments in the conclusion for that 
        flight. The Boeing 787-9 flight was meant for the plane and time. The meal was forgettable, but I 
        appreciate that there was something with some nutrition (carbs or protein, I never said it’s 
        completely carbs and protein) to eat on this flight. I didn’t go into the IFE that much, so I don’t 
        have any comments other than the screen and moving map is decent. In summary, this is the standard 
        domestic flight in China, and the aircraft type and time fit my schedule, so it did the job.
