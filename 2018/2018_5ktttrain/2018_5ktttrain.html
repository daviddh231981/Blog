      <h2>Ktt Guangzhou East to Hong Kong</h2>

      <p>
        After my flight from Beijing, I went to Guangzhou East and met up with a few friends of mine. We had lunch at a
        mall across the street. That is for after the train report. We entered via underground tunnel, so no entrance
        pics today.

        Upstairs was a waiting lounge on the top floor.

      <p>
        <img src="IMG_4833.JPG" alt="ticket (alt text)" height="3024" width="4032">
        Here was my ticket (the said friends brought it for me a few days ago). It's just over $30 USD for a class above
        First Class, a two-hour train ride.

        bottle of water for the ride, and line up.

        On the other side of the fence is the 25T train provided by the Chinese (I think the Guangzhou Railway Bureau
        provides these special trainsets).

        <img src="IMG_4842.JPG" alt="carriage 6 (alt text)" height="3024" width="4032">
        Then let’s hop in (carriage 6 is not ours, but that was the one I grabbed a photo of). Carriage 4 is the
        “Premium Class” carriage, if I remember correctly.

        Here’s a picture looking down, this was during the middle of the ride.

        <img src="IMG_4883.JPG" alt="table (alt text)" height="3024" width="4032">
        With the seat came with a massive table. It was used for completing the landing card and reading a book.

        “Drink” and snack were served… that water was consumed in a big gulp, while that snack was consumed within a few
        minutes. There was a menu of other things for purchase. I’m glad I brought water for the ride…

        I visited the bathroom. It wasn’t the cleanest, but it did the job.

      <p>
        This train did the job, and I’m kind of glad I took this detour to meet up with some friends of mine. Seat pitch
        was decent, and there was… refreshment of some sort. Though next time, I’d fly into Hong Kong from Beijing
        rather than take this detour (meals are actually provided on this route).

        Oh, here’s the food from lunch with friends that I was talking about earlier. Unfortunately, I don’t remember
        the name, but it was decent enough to hold me until Hong Kong.
