      <h2>Days Hotel Beijing New Exhibition Center, Beijing</h2>

      <p>
        <img src="i1.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Exterior of the hotel." height="3024" width="4032">
        I got to the hotel sometime in the early evening. I had no clue when check-in was, probably around this time. I rode with a friend of mine (who will be spending the night with me here). The entrance makes this hotel look like a convention center. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i2.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Entrance of the hotel." height="3024" width="4032">
        While my friend parked his car, I decided to wait at the front. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i3.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Robot helper." height="4032" width="3024">
        There’s a robot that does most of the work.

      <p>
        <img src="i4.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Hallway." height="3024" width="4032">
        My friend did the check-in, and we went into the hotel hallway. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i5.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: More hallway." height="3024" width="4032">
        <img src="i6.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Even more hallway." height="4032" width="3024">
        Which seemed to be endless as we went to some different part of the hotel. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i7.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: First glance." height="3024" width="4032">
        First look was ok. A mix between old and new. Let’s go in further. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i8.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Beds of the room." height="3024" width="4032">
        Two beds. Each of us had two.

      <p>
        <img src="i9.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Desk of the room." height="3024" width="4032">
        A desk, for work.

        Toilet.

        Shower room…

        <img src="i17.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: View from the room." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the view from my room, which was not particularly enticing. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i18.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Hotel Restaurant Seating." height="2760" width="4912">
        My friend and I went to the hotel restaurant (found in the basement) to get dinner, as I guessed that my chances of getting something more substantial than a box of instant noodles was not looking good. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i19.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Booth." height="2760" width="4912">
        Here’s a booth. The host wanted to seat us at a table; I asked if we could sit together at a booth and the host agreed. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i20.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Food menu 1." height="4912" width="2760">
        Here’s the food menu (which isn’t very long) …
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i21.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Food menu 2." height="2760" width="4912">
        Because this is the second page (well, the back). Overall, about 15 options deep. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i22.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Drink menu." height="2760" width="4912">
        The drink menu was more substantial. I’m wondering if the “Freshly Squeezed Juice” was legitimately freshly squeezed (probably squeezed earlier in the day), but I don’t have evidence. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i23.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: My drink selection." height="2760" width="4912">
        I just went with a Chinese ginger ale. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i24.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Noodles." height="2760" width="4912">
        My friend had the “wonton noodles” on the back of the menu. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="i25.JPG" alt="ALT TEXT: Sandwich." height="2760" width="4912">
        I went with the “Days Club sandwich”, which was really good for my expectations. I would order it again without hesitation! 
      </p>

      <p>
        This hotel did its job well. This being a Days Inn, I was impressed by the quality of this hotel. This is quite the good deal anyone booking here can get. Highly recommended for the night before the airport or as an overnight connection.
