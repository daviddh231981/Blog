      <h2>Cathay Pacific Boeing 777-300ER Chicago to Hong Kong and Back</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="1.JPG" alt="terminal 5." height="3024" width="4032">
        Last time, I started in Terminal 1. This time… Terminal 5. I’ve arrived at Terminal 5 before, but not departed from it. It doesn’t have TSA Precheck, but it was rather quiet… if you went to the right place. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="2.JPG" alt="plane to hong kong." height="2760" width="4912">
        B-KPA (Cathay Pacific’s first Boeing 777-300ER) flew me Chicago to Hong Kong. I much prefer the old livery and was glad to see this plane retained it. It was involved in a catering truck accident in Zurich four years ago. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="3.JPG" alt="plane to chicago." height="3024" width="4032">
        I got B-KPU on the flight from Hong Kong to Chicago. It was painted in the new livery, but that was quite the contrast! 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="4.JPG" alt="pu on the nose." height="3024" width="4032">
        How do I feel about the new livery? Look at the last two letters of the registration. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="5.JPG" alt="cabin." height="3024" width="4032">
        Boarding in both directions felt a little chaotic, but I guess it was efficient? Interestingly it was more orderly ex-ORD. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="6.JPG" alt="cabin." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s pictures of the forward economy cabin. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="7.JPG" alt="cabin." height="3024" width="4032">
        Which feels a little bit on the older side! 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="8.JPG" alt="cabin." height="3024" width="4032">
        It did feel quite large. But the configuration makes it so (9-abreast 3x3x3 compared to the 10-abreast 3x4x3 many carriers use, and which CX will reconfigure their 777s into). 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="9.JPG" alt="cabin." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the rear economy cabin, where I sat for the flights. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="10.JPG" alt="thumbs up for the legroom." height="2760" width="4912">
        The pitch was 32”, and the width was 18.5”, all to the accuracy of my measuring tape. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="11.JPG" alt="overhead lights only." height="2760" width="4912">
        Overhead panels… not really so good with no air vents, but the flight was in the winter. I imagine it would be a different story on a hot summer day, or near the equator in Asia. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="12.JPG" alt="view from the back." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the view from the back. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="13.JPG" alt="menu ex-ORD." height="4912" width="2760">
        On both directions, a menu was passed out. Here’s the menu ex-ORD. The back side is in Cantonese. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="14.JPG" alt="drink to start." height="2760" width="4912">
        I started with a Coke Zero (they don’t have Diet Coke) to drink, which was served with peanuts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="15.JPG" alt="meal tray." height="2760" width="4912">
        Meal was served on a rather large tray. I had a Perrier to go with it. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="16.JPG" alt="pasta." height="2760" width="4912">
        Here’s the pasta option. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="17.JPG" alt="rice." height="2760" width="4912">
        Here’s the chicken and rice. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="18.JPG" alt="potatoes." height="2760" width="4912">
        Here’s my selection, which was mashed potatoes with beef. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="19.JPG" alt="size." height="2760" width="4912">
        The size is rather good, too! So was the meal. I enjoyed the turkey coleslaw salad. Seatmates reported the other selections good.  
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="20.JPG" alt="dessert." height="2760" width="4912">
        Ice cream bars for dessert. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="21.JPG" alt="dessert." height="2760" width="4912">
        Which were kind of hard, but I enjoyed it! 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="22.JPG" alt="tea." height="2760" width="4912">
        I had a tea before bed. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="23.JPG" alt="meal tray." height="2760" width="4912">
        Here’s the second meal, served mid-flight. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="24.JPG" alt="shrimp." height="2760" width="4912">
        The shrimp fried rice option. Seatmates reported it good. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="25.JPG" alt="chicken." height="2760" width="4912">
        The orzo with chicken option. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="26.JPG" alt="fruit." height="2760" width="4912">
        And fresh fruit was served! I also enjoyed the Chocolate Mousse, but I have a sweet tooth! 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="27.JPG" alt="menu ex-HKG." height="4032" width="3024">
        Here’s the menu, ex-HKG. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="28.JPG" alt="drink to start." height="2760" width="4912">
        I started with another coke but didn’t get the can this time. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="29.JPG" alt="meal tray." height="2760" width="4912">
        The tray was identical, and I had to ask for the full can. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="30.JPG" alt="rice." height="2760" width="4912">
        Here’s the chicken and rice option.

      <p>
        <img src="31.JPG" alt="potatoes." height="2760" width="4912">
        Here’s my selection, the mashed potatoes and beef. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="32.JPG" alt="salad." height="2760" width="4912">
        A shrimp salad was served with it. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="33.JPG" alt="dessert." height="2760" width="4912">
        Ice cream for dessert, we got Movenpick chocolate ice cream. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="34.JPG" alt="dessert." height="2760" width="4912">
        Again, hard as a rock. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="35.JPG" alt="meal tray." height="3024" width="4032">
        The second meal was served mid-flight. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="36.JPG" alt="spoon." height="3024" width="4032">
        Kind of cheap plastic spoon for what? 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="37.JPG" alt="chicken." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the potatoes and chicken option.

        <img src="38.JPG" alt="fish." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the fish and rice. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="39.JPG" alt="dessert." height="3024" width="4032">
        The custard… with a layer of water. Eww… it was bland too. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="40.JPG" alt="instant noodles." height="3024" width="4032">
        If, ex-HKG, I were to pick my favorite meal, you’d be surprised to see me pick the “instant noodles” that were “available upon request” because, honestly, the rest were eww. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="41.JPG" alt="catering truck ex-ORD." height="2760" width="4912">
        Which was a little disappointment for CX’s catering in-house. I guessed that catering ex-ORD was outsourced based on this Do & Co truck I saw. By the way, Do & Co is a very good brand. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="42.JPG" alt="IFE." height="3024" width="4032">
        On the flight to Hong Kong on B-KPA, the newer entertainment system was used. It was quite fast. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="43.JPG" alt="nose camera." height="2760" width="4912">
        It had the nose camera. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="44.JPG" alt="screen." height="2760" width="4912">
        The entertainment screen was easy to use. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="45.JPG" alt="map." height="2760" width="4912">
        It had a decent moving map too. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="46.JPG" alt="3d." height="2760" width="4912">
        With 3D views. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="47.JPG" alt="travel information." height="2760" width="4912">
        Travel information is also provided on the IFE. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="48.JPG" alt="flight time." height="2760" width="4912">
        B-KPA, despite having the older paint, had been installed with Wi-Fi. Though the flight time was not synced together. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="49.PNG" alt="internet plans on my iPhone" height="1334" width="750">
        The screenshots were from my iPhone. The internet plans seemed reasonable for the second option, although it was quite steep for the hour pass. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="50.PNG" alt="internet coverage worldwide map" height="1334" width="750">
        Coverage was quite good, and yes, it seemed to include Mainland China. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="51.JPG" alt="connecting flights." height="3024" width="4032">
        Nearing arrival, connecting flight information was available for display. HKG is a major transit point in Asia. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="52.JPG" alt="airport information." height="3024" width="4032">
        Meanwhile, I wasn’t connecting, so I found airport information. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="53.JPG" alt="screen." height="3024" width="4032">
        On B-KPU, the seats had the older IFE system. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="54.JPG" alt="nose camera." height="3024" width="4032">
        But still had the nose camera. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="55.JPG" alt="headphones." height="4032" width="3024">
        Extremely cheap headphones were provided, and I didn’t find it useful. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="56.JPG" alt="snack bar." height="3024" width="4032">
        A “snack bar” was set in the galley mid-flight. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This flight was a great way to cross the Pacific. I liked the wide seats with good legroom, the food was a mixed bag, though. Not too different than flying with
