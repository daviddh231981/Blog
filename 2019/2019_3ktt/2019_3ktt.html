      <h2>Ktt train Hong Kong (Kowloon) to Guangzhou-East</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="1.JPG" alt="Info screen." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
        At Hung Hom station, I cleared Hong Kong exit formalities and was directed to a waiting room that looked like a warehouse. <br><br>

        <img src="2.JPG" alt="Train ticket." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
        Tickets are in order, though. I brought them a few days before at the train station but wasn't too careful about the seat assignment. That's when I realized I had a lower deck seat. Whatever. <br><br>

        <img src="3.JPG" alt="Platforms." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
        Descending to platforms on the same level as the local subway trains. And getting a “premium class” seat (which is apparently above first class) means nothing other than a larger seat and perhaps a snack and shot of water. <br><br>

        <img src="4.JPG" alt="Interior." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
        These seats look dated, and so does the interior. It's worn, but yet, the padding was decent. <br><br>

        <img src="5.JPG" alt="Legroom." height="2760" width="4912"><br>
        Legroom on trains is usually good, especially if they're longer-distance trains. <br><br>

        <img src="6.JPG" alt="Legroom." height="2760" width="4912"><br>
        Much better than any plane. <br><br>

        <img src="7.JPG" alt="Seat audio system." height="2760" width="4912"><br>
        As another example of how dated these seats were, here's an inoperative audio system in the seat. <br><br>

        <img src="8.JPG" alt="Light." height="2760" width="4912"><br>
        Although the light worked, even if the label is just a sticker. <br><br>

        Immediately after we left, I moved upstairs and found a seat with an actual table! Well, there were two seats facing each other with a table in the middle, but no one else was on the train. Save for this lady that was pacing the entire train. Good on her for getting her steps in today. <br><br>

        <img src="9.JPG" alt="Refreshment." height="2760" width="4912"><br>
        Here's the refreshment that I was talking about earlier, passed out the second the train left the station. <br><br>

        <img src="10.JPG" alt="New Territories." height="2760" width="4912"><br>
        This train passes the New Territories…<br><br>

        <img src="11.JPG" alt="East Rail Line." height="2760" width="4912"><br>
        And every station on the East Rail Line. <br><br>

        <img src="12.JPG" alt="Cracker." height="2760" width="4912"><br>
        Now, I have a chance to take a look at the "refreshment." The cracker is basic…<br><br>

        <img src="13.JPG" alt="Two crackers." height="2760" width="4912"><br>
        But at least there were two. <br><br>

        This train stops at Changping station, but I only saw probably two people get off. As far as I'm aware, there were only a few doors that were opened, and all were on different parts of the train. <br><br>

        <img src="14.PNG" alt="Internet." height="750" width="1334"><br>
        I did connect to the internet… which is also when I realized I forgot to turn off airplane mode. <br><br>

        I have no clue how full the first class carriages were, but I totally did not learn my lesson from last year. That's on me. Lesson learned again. <br><br>

        Oh wait. You pay an extra 55 RMB… for the convenience of not needing to walk all the way to the end of the train. Because these carriages are in the middle, right next to the escalators to and from the station waiting area. Wow, that's quite impressive! (I'm being a little bit sarcastic). Because you don't need to carry all of your stuff across the platform! (Ok, I'm not being sarcastic anymore). <br><br>

        So yeah. I'll spend the 55 RMB on something else. Maybe food. So that I won't be cranky about the product. <br><br>
