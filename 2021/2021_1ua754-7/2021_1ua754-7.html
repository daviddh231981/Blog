      <h3>Below is Post 1.</h3>

      <p>
        This will be my first time flying since the onset of the Covid pandemic. I did not fly at all in 2020. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJPMxBxh3eI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        I made a video about this trip. Check it out!
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="1.JPG" alt="walkway to the terminal." height="1980" width="3520">
        I got to the airport around 5:00am for a 6:30am departure. Since I was only planning to be out for a full day, I just parked in the daily lot. It’s going to cost me $42 bucks… then it’s a walk to the elevator to the skyway to the terminal. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="2.JPG" alt="check-in level." height="4032" width="3024">
        Downstairs there’s a sign showing what’s open for security, etc. I just went to the check-in desk to print out new boarding passes, even though I checked in last night. The purpose is because I only had mobile boarding passes. At the check-in area, I was asked to wait for an open kiosk, but multiple people cut in line and got the agent a little frustrated, so I told her I was just going to use the Premier Access line (as part of my Premier status). 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="3.JPG" alt="Concourse E." height="4032" width="3024">
        Security was faster than I expected as someone flying with TSA Precheck. Within minutes, I was cleared and walking into Concourse E. Though I had to eat breakfast first; I grabbed a meal at McDonalds for convenience. On a Wednesday morning, none of the TSA lines appeared long. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="4.JPG" alt="plane to ORD." height="4032" width="3024">
        Here’s my plane. N67827 will fly UA754 to Chicago today; it flew as UA783 last night into Minneapolis.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="5.JPG" alt="potato quality photo if i zoom in." height="4032" width="3024">
        Unfortunately, I was using my iPhone Xr…
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="o.JPG" alt="from BWI." height="4032" width="3024">
        The seats were the same as a Baltimore to Chicago flight I took in October 2019 as well as a Minneapolis to Denver flight I took in December 2019 (minus the TV and Boeing Sky Interior). Being late in the boarding process, I just borrowed a picture from aircraft #3889 (N62889). That’s the view from 4B.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="6.JPG" alt="blanket." height="4032" width="3024">
        And a blanket was provided for this short flight, not that I needed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="7.JPG" alt="needs maintenance." height="4032" width="3024">
        Gosh, this poor bird definitely needs some maintenance. Look at the armrest holding the tray table. Bad part was I couldn’t even shove it down (not that I was going to try). It wasn’t a problem for this flight, though. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="8.JPG" alt="Spirit to LA." height="4032" width="3024">
        Here’s that Spirit A319-132 to Los Angeles (I think). 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="9.JPG" alt="view from 4A." height="3024" width="4032">
        And the view from 4A. Not a bad engine view. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="10.JPG" alt="overhead panel." height="4032" width="3024">
        The overhead panel is standard, not that I was looking for much. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="11.JPG" alt="Spirit leaves before we do." height="3024" width="4032">
        And the Spirit pushed back before we did, they had the same departure time. Boarding was taking a while on this plane, probably as there were likely a lot of inexperienced travelers. The purser gave instructions on what to do after boarding and stated that a lot of passengers had connections (I had one that was 1 hour 9 minutes… eek!).
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="12.JPG" alt="jetbridge removed." height="4032" width="3024">
        And with the jetbridge removed, we were almost ready as the FAs rushed to prepare the cabin. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="13.JPG" alt="Delta B753." height="1980" width="3520">
        And that’s a Delta Boeing 757-351 with PW2000 engines. One of the rare B753s.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="14.JPG" alt="taxi out of ramp control." height="1980" width="3520">
        We pushed back almost 10 minutes late, started engines, and went out. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="15.JPG" alt="takeoff." height="1980" width="3520">
        Takeoff from Runway 17, a slight left immediately after we went airborne, and into the haze from the northwestern wildfires, particularly horrible this year. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="s1.PNG" alt="Wi-Fi landing page." height="1792" width="828">
        <img src="s2.PNG" alt="Flight info." height="1792" width="828">
        Here’s screenshots of the United Wi-Fi page, including flight information. I didn’t see the price for that, not that I needed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="16.JPG" alt="Snack bag." height="3024" width="4032">
        Thanks to the pandemic, we were offered an “All-in-one snack bag” which contained water, pretzel, and Stroopwafel. I didn’t eat anything in there and saved it for later. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="17.JPG" alt="coffee." height="4032" width="3024">
        I did have a coffee, one sugar. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="18.JPG" alt="Loo visit." height="3024" width="4032">
        After drinks were passed out, I went to the lavatory. Unsurprisingly we have the really small sink that’s a trademark of most narrowbodies. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="19.JPG" alt="Wing." height="3024" width="4032">
        And I grabbed a picture of the wing in the middle of cruise. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="20.JPG" alt="Parking at B6." height="3024" width="4032">
        We parked at Gate B6, right next to a sistership. From there, I dashed out of the plane and to B16 for my next flight.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="s3.PNG" alt="Flight status details after landing." height="1792" width="828">
        Here is the flight status details from the United App. 
      </p>
