      <h3>Below is Post 2.</h3>

      <p>
        There are going to be sections in this post as there are two flights combined into one. So, some of the intro pictures are from Orlando, but I actually flew Chicago to Orlando to Chicago. Meaning that some of these pictures are not going to be in the correct order.
      </p>

      <p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BSxmQh6PdMc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        I did make a video about these flight, check it out! 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="1.JPG" alt="Plane at Gate 48." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the plane kind of “cooling off” from a short hop after the Chicago to Orlando flight (UA1944), it will return to Chicago in around an hour (UA1500). 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="2.JPG" alt="Eagle at Gate 48." height="3024" width="4032">
        If you look from far in the distance, it kind of looks a bit scary, no? I mean, one could mistake it as a hunting bird. Honestly, now that I think of it, it kind of looks as fierce as an, shall we say, eagle. Both an eagle and this plane flies in the air, no? I just cropped the face of an eagle onto the plane. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="3.JPG" alt="Plane being catered." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s a close-up of the bird. Now it’s a bit less scary. It’s N2142U, by the way (nose #2142).
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="4.JPG" alt="Plane alongside a picture of an eagle." height="3024" width="4032">
        Or maybe not… after all, it’s a bird that just spotted its prey. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Haters will say it isn’t fierce. But it’s got two of the strongest turbofans in the world. So… ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="5.PNG" alt="Boarding as I arrived." height="1792" width="828">
        After I landed from Minneapolis, I made a mad dash from B6 to B16, which is probably like 10 gates away (there’s no B13 due to some superstition). Screenshot from the United App. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="6.JPG" alt="Boarding signs." height="3024" width="4032">
        This is where they were with boarding when I got there. So, good timing as I was Group 1 and Group 2 boarding hasn't started yet. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="7.JPG" alt="Blue jetbridges to the plane." height="4032" width="3024">
        I enjoy the blue jetbridges. Something I missed from over a year (and a half) of not flying through ORD. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="8.JPG" alt="Boarding through L2." height="3024" width="4032">
        I boarded through L1 just for the experience. Here’s how it looked from the end of the jetbridge. Both forward and rear first (Polaris) cabins were rather full. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="9.JPG" alt="Entryway at L2." height="3024" width="4032">
        There’s a plaque at L2, which I think improves the cabin aesthetics. This was taken during cruise, on the outbound to Orlando. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="10.JPG" alt="Rear Polaris cabin." height="3024" width="4032">
        When I boarded, most of the First Class (Polaris seat) cabin was full of people, so these pictures were ex-MCO, and the cabin doesn’t seem to be the cleanest as ex-ORD. I’m hoping this isn’t the situation for international flights. Here’s the rear cabin, containing 32 of the 60 seats. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="11.JPG" alt="Forward Polaris cabin." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here is the forward cabin. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="12.JPG" alt="Bar area." height="3024" width="4032">
        There’s a bar area (“Midflight Hospitality Area”) that was not used for either flight (it’s a domestic hop to Orlando, why does it matter?).
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="13.JPG" alt="Attention to detail on the ceiling." height="3024" width="4032">
        The attention to detail was really good by the design team, just look up. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="14.JPG" alt="Seat 9A." height="3024" width="4032">
        Ex-ORD, I had 9A. This seat contains a bassinet and should be selected with caution when flying long-haul or internationally, but this wasn’t offered during this short hop. More on the positives of this seat later. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="14.JPG" alt="Seat 5L." height="3024" width="4032">
        Ex-MCO, I had 5L. This is one of the better seats in the cabin (any odd row number is) because of the privacy. Not that the others are half bad either… but I would pick these seats anyday. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="16.JPG" alt="View from 9A after boarding." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the view after boarding. Not bad. A lot of people commented about the seat while boarding, and they were positive comments “first class looks nice”. It’s definitely much better than the recliners used! 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="17.JPG" alt="Shoulder strap is mandatory for portions of the flight." height="4032" width="3024">
        All seats have a shoulder strap, required for certain periods of the flight (taxi, takeoff, landing, etc.). Though it didn’t seem to be enforced during turbulence. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="18.JPG" alt="Good engine view from 9A." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the view from 9A, which is a really nice engine view. Get rid of the other plane and flip this picture horizontally for an impression of the view from 9L. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="19.JPG" alt="Ok engine view from 5L." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the view from 5A. Not half bad, much quieter (minus engine startup). Flip horizontally and add jetbridge connected to this plane for an impression of the view from 5A. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="20.JPG" alt="Lamp at each seat." height="3024" width="4032">
        Each seat comes with a decent lamp lighting (feels a bit like home), as well as a reading light over the shoulder, remote, 110V, USB port, USB port, and 2-prong headphone jack. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="21.JPG" alt="Storage compartment." height="3024" width="4032">
        But what takes up the most space here is the storage compartment. I put in a water bottle but later tossed in a camcorder. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="22.JPG" alt="Dirty mirror." height="4032" width="3024">
        Here’s a mirror too, though it’s quite dirty. I removed the headphones from the hook but didn’t use it at all. I used it in 2019 and wasn’t quite impressed. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="23.JPG" alt="Adjustable headrest." height="3024" width="4032">
        The headrest is also quite adjustable. But the best part is not the headrest…
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="24.JPG" alt="Lie-flat seat." height="3024" width="4032">
        It’s the lie-flat seat! It can lie completely flat and is controlled by some seat controller. I like the wheel, but apparently some people have bumped into it (I did once on the return, but it was while I was standing, cleaning up my seat during the boarding process).
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="25.JPG" alt="Choose the first row in Polaris." height="3024" width="4032">
        This is why you should choose the bulkhead (rows 1 and 9 on either Boeing 777 aircraft), because of the decent footwell. Though the footrest that extends from the seat isn’t exactly made to fit snugly against the part closest to the wall (about 2 inches at the widest), given those were made for other odd-numbered rows. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="26.JPG" alt="Storage cubby underneath the IFE screen." height="3024" width="4032">
        By this time, one should note the storage cubby, which doesn’t seem to be allowed to be used during takeoff, so the adaptor was placed into the larger storage cabinet just off to my right shoulder. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="27.JPG" alt="Camera bag in footwell." height="3024" width="4032">
        This is my camera bag, tossed into the footwell for reference. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="28.JPG" alt="Camera bag underneath footwell." height="4032" width="3024">
        I had to move it underneath for the critical portions of the flight. I don’t know whether it’s actually allowed to be there for takeoff (if it wasn’t, I would just toss it in the overhead bin and grab it first opportunity I get), but no one seemed to have a problem with this. I want to note that it seems that each seat got its own overhead bin, so storage shouldn’t be an issue here (meaning that everyone can bring the regular carry-on allowance without running into storage issues). It was not an issue for me today, with a backpack and a camera bag.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="29.JPG" alt="Legroom at 9A." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the legroom for 9A (and possibly row 1). 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="30.JPG" alt="Legroom at 5L." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the legroom for 5L (and any other odd-numbered seat, basically).
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="31.JPG" alt="Sanitizing wipe on boarding." height="4032" width="3024">
        Upon boarding, I got this sanitizing wipe for my seat. That seems to replace the pre-departure beverage, which I probably took for granted before the pandemic. I just drank out of my water bottle.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="32.JPG" alt="Hand sanitizer along the plane." height="4032" width="3024">
        Then United seemed to install hand sanitizer dispensers around the plane, which was nice and hopefully stays. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="33.JPG" alt="Lavatory at L2 (left side)." height="4032" width="3024">
        The lavatories ahead of Door L1 are not too big. They’re in the aisle to the cockpit. It’ll probably be blocked if a pilot needs to use a lavatory. Don’t use those for changing. Instead, use the one by Door L2. There’s two at the second doors of each side. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="34.JPG" alt="Lavatory at R2 (right side)." height="4032" width="3024">
        The one on the left side are far more spacious than the one on the right because of the absence of stowage. It’s logical. There’s no other way to toss in a large lavatory there without changing any of the 32 business class seats plus 24 premium economy (Premium Plus) seats. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="35.JPG" alt="Sink at the lavatories are identical." height="3024" width="4032">
        The sink looks identical at all of the lavatories. I appreciate how these sinks were automatic. These pictures of inside the lavatory were taken during boarding, by the way, and only one person used it before I did. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="36.JPG" alt="Toilet." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the toilet. For the other lavatories, just imagine that without the empty space to the right. It’s really clean because the plane was cleaned after coming in as UA219 from Honolulu about 3 hours ago. I don’t think I can say the same during boarding, ex-MCO, because it spent less than 2 hours on the ground. It wasn’t the cleanest, but usable. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="37.JPG" alt="Sunday Riley amenities ready for use in the lavatory." height="4032" width="3024">
        Sunday Riley amenities were also available. I tried the hand moisturizer (my hands are always dry). Remarkable on a plane, but you won’t believe how horribly dry my hands can get. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="38.JPG" alt="Privacy from 9A." height="3024" width="4032">
        Privacy from 9A was nice. Note the coat hook holding my hat.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="39.JPG" alt="Privacy from 5L." height="3024" width="4032">
        5L, not too shabby, but I could see the screen of 4G. This time, the coat hook also has my sweatshirt; no blankets on domestic first so I used it as one. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="40.JPG" alt="Bulkhead of the rear cabin." height="3024" width="4032">
        The bulkhead of the rear cabin is nicely designed. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="41.JPG" alt="Bulkhead of the forward cabin." height="3024" width="4032">
        As is the bulkhead of the forward cabin. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="42.JPG" alt="Safety card of the B77X." height="4032" width="3024">
        I always check the safety card, regardless of aircraft type, but most of the time it’s mostly the same. This is a B77X (not the Boeing 777X),  and pink kind of seems off brand for United. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="43.JPG" alt="View from my seat when fully flat." height="4032" width="3024">
        When I reclined 9A into its lie-flat configuration, this is what I see when looking directly up. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="44.JPG" alt="Seatbelt sign is turned off, overhead panel is nice." height="3024" width="4032">
        When the seatbelt sign was turned off, I snapped a picture of the overhead panel. The light is controlled by only the remote or IFE. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="45.JPG" alt="Drink menu." height="4032" width="3024">
        Here’s the drink options (non-alcoholic) from the magazine. UA is the only carrier flying with their magazine at the time of writing, as far as I know. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="46.JPG" alt="Snackbox menu." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here are the snackbox options. I tried both the Tapas and Takeoff options; the Recline option was not offered to me. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="47.JPG" alt="Orange juice to drink." height="3024" width="4032">
        Ex-ORD, I had an Orange Juice to drink. Not ordering that again, it was horrible and I am not a fan of “juice from concentrate” in any case. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Ex-ORD, I was offered a snackbox or hot sandwich selections of “Everything baguette, which is kinda vegetarian and comes with veggies and cheese, or the ham and egg [croissant]”, very descriptive! What wasn’t descriptive was the snackbox, so I asked for that. The FA walked out with a tray full of food and walked back to grab another snackbox and continued to do so, all while being descriptive in offering the food. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="48.JPG" alt="Tapas snackbox." height="3024" width="4032">
        I do wish I had something to compare the size of that with, but oh well. Here it is, in all its glory, the “Tapas snackbox”.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="49.JPG" alt="Contents of the Tapas Snackbox." height="3024" width="4032">
        I opened it and set its contents on the tray table. By the way, I cleaned the tray table, and it’s all packaged, so I didn’t feel too bad. Oh dear. It looked horrific. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The almonds were tasty, well-seasoned, and probably one of the best parts of the snackbox (in the sense that it had the most flavor). Both dipping sauces (“bruschetta spread” and “traditional hummus”) were rather bland, which meant that they didn’t compliment well with the “Italian breadsticks” nor “sourdough flatbread crackers” to make a difference. The olives had much more flavor than either dipping sauce. Finally, I have a sweet tooth (maybe even two), so the chocolate was nice. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="50.JPG" alt="I had a ginger ale to drink." height="3024" width="4032">
        When a FA went to collect my trash, she asked me if there was something else she could get me. I asked for a ginger ale, solely to wash down the snack box. That, alone, should be telling. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="51.JPG" alt="Sparkling water to drink." height="3024" width="4032">
        Ex-MCO, I asked for sparkling water, “flavored or unflavored?” I had the “flavored” option, which turned out to be…
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="52.JPG" alt="Can of the drink." height="4032" width="3024">
        “AHA Sparkling Water”. I kid you not, this is the actual brand of this water. I’ve never tried it before, never heard of it before, and was really surprised to see this. Of course, I probably should’ve been aware when reading the magazine, but seems United did away with the “Dasani’s Lime Sparkling Water” option. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="53.JPG" alt="Bunch of zeros on the nutrution table." height="4032" width="3024">
        The nutrition info didn’t really sound interesting at all. Bunch of zeros…
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="54.JPG" alt="Flavoring of the sparkling water." height="4032" width="3024">
        This is what AHA writes about the flavor. By the way, the flavor was “Orange + Grapefruit”, not “Lime”. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="55.JPG" alt="Takeoff snackbox." height="3024" width="4032">
        Ex-MCO, it seems that only snackboxes were offered. Having tried the “Tapas” on the outbound, I tried the “Takeoff” option. By the way, this was served an hour after takeoff due to turbulence requiring the captain to advise the FAs to take their jumpseats. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="56.JPG" alt="Contents of the Takeoff snackbox." height="3024" width="4032">
        I opened the box to find a bit more in this box. Of course, I had the almonds first. They’re cold (as with either snackbox), but still nice. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="57.JPG" alt="Laid out on the tray table." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the contents. Some resemblance to the other snackbox (two breads and two dips), but this contained meat (probably in lieu of olives), Toblerone (probably in lieu of the chocolate), and apricots (this time it’s not in lieu of anything else; it’s an extra item over the other snackbox). The dips were much more flavorful than the other snackbox (ok, I’m a cheese person from Wisconsin). I also like how the Salami Slices were from “Old Wisconsin”, the company of which has quite a bit of history originating from Sheboygan back in 1942. As a Wisconsinite, I am happy and that was a highlight of the snackbox. I am going to offer no comment on the Toblerone. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I didn’t ask for ginger ale this time to wash it down. I packed my trash into one box for the FA’s convenience when they pick it up, turned on “Do Not Disturb”, and went to sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Out of the two snackboxes, I enjoyed the “Takeoff” much more than the “Tapas” because of the flavor and the meat option (though the “Tapas” is vegetarian, I am not, so that may factor into one’s decision). These cost $10 to buy if flying in Economy; I would not spend that much on either. I would place the “Tapas” snackbox worth $5 and the “Takeoff” worth $8. I’d rather spend the $10 on a cheeseburger or hot dog (later). I could buy a McDonald’s meal for less than $10 (burger, fries, and drink)!

        As the Tokyo Olympics were near, I watched a documentary when I had my first snackbox, ex-ORD (I didn’t watch anything except the moving map ex-MCO).

        Split-screen mode was also something that was nice, I viewed the moving map in split-screen just to experience it. The IFE system won a Crystal Cabin award recently.

        Boarding (and deplaning) in Orlando was through L2 only (there was only one jetbridge), so I turned left after boarding. It’s always exciting to turn left after boarding, and it means for quieter during boarding.

        Though not always. The overhead bin popped open during taxi to the runway at Orlando. Thankfully that didn’t become a problem as a FA noticed that and joked with passengers nearby about it.

        <img src="72.JPG" alt="Takeoff is quieter. View from 5L during takeoff." height="1980" width="3520">
        It is so much more quieter during takeoff from the forward cabin, versus the rear cabin. It’s probably more quieter at row 1.

        Of course, I had the Louisville hot dog from America’s Dog in Chicago. Either would cost less than $10, but the total was around $17 after buying water.

        Service was nice onboard. First, I got recognized from a Hong Kong flight two years ago! I am honestly so surprised that happened, and it shows that we live in a small world! She flew with us ex-ORD as well. I don’t know if she was based in Hong Kong or Chicago before the pandemic, though. Not a good time to ask. Second, I noted how another FA was incredibly patient with a passenger who was hard of hearing. She went above and beyond, helping him with reclining the seat, the IFE, etc. Third, it must be a little frustrating to have to state the descriptions of the food over and over as well as walk back to the galley every time to replenish. This is incredibly personal and incredibly nice, and I appreciated it. Finally, I appreciate how the crew was most likely worrying during the pandemic about many things, such as their job security, how they’ll make ends meet, and the fear of dealing with a passenger who is unruly and/or refuses to wear a mask (throwing a “fit” along the way).

        A kicker was how the moving map stopped showing anything besides a plain map after landing in both directions, which I didn’t understand. Maybe just show the route and vitals (speed, heading, etc.)?

        Overall, not bad. As for the hard product, I never complain about a lie-flat seat on a two/three-hour domestic hop, and you shouldn’t either. It might be worth the upgrade, it might not. But it’s still lie-flat. If you’re seated in it, then what more can you say? Don’t complain when it’s a widebody, either! As for the soft product, meh. I would rather spend $20 (probably even less than that) for more of the food and beverage offered (a full meal and a larger bottle or two, versus a snackbox and two cans of drinks). Plus, I like stroopwafels (though it’s on me for not asking for one “from the back”).

      <p>
        
        And it’s more certain that I can’t complain about it when this was a complimentary upgrade on a $545 S-class fare bucket for four flights. As a Premier, I get to sit in First Class where available, for free! Three out of my four flights cleared, including the two featured in this report. I am appreciative of what I got and have no reason to complain.

        I am glad I caught this “secret upgrade” of an aircraft. If United really wanted to put a widebody on this route, they would’ve likely thrown a Boeing 777-200 configured in high density with significantly fewer first class seats in a significantly worse configuration. Not to mention no IFE for Economy. That didn’t happen thanks to the Boeing 777-200 grounding with PW engines.

      <p>
        
        60 first class seats out of 350 total is a bit much, though. More than 50% of the cabin either goes out empty or is filled with complimentary upgrades. There is no way United will turn a profit with this aircraft on this route as there is no way there’s that much premium demand. Next month, this flight will be flown with a Boeing 757-300 with significantly less first class seats but with a decent amount of economy seats.
