        <img src="1.JPG" alt="Crossing the tunnel." height="3024" width="4032">
        After landing in Chicago and eating a rather tasty dinner, I crossed the tunnel into Concourse B. I have not crossed that tunnel in too long, so I figured I should do so. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="2.JPG" alt="Entrance to the United Club." height="3024" width="4032">
        I went to the club across gate B6. On a previous visit, I went to the club <a href="/2018/2018_1uaclub/2018_1uaclub.html">at gate B18</a> but this time, I wanted to try a different one. I had a pass I wanted to burn anyways (not literally).

        Besides, my connection was delayed too.

        <img src="5.JPG" alt="Escalators upstairs." height="3024" width="4032">
        After getting my passes scanned by the lounge agent at the door (she was really nice, so I hesitate to call her “lounge dragon”), I had to take an escalator upstairs. Ok, so this should really set up some expectations, right? Having to change floor levels, hmm? Otherwise, must’ve been too small to set up a decent lounge, right? 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="6.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032">
        Here’s the view once upstairs. Yeah… good luck finding a seat. For reference, it’s 5 pm. The lounge closes at 10 pm the day I was there. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="7.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032">
        There was a very mediocre spread of food, I did take a few of the more “substantial” items.

        <img src="9.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032">
        There’s hot water for the instant noodles (lol) and two barista-style coffee machines. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="10.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032">
        There was also decaf and plain coffee, and a coke machine for soft drinks and “juice” (bunch of sugar). 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="11.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032">
        There are private phone rooms.

      <p>
        <img src="12.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032">
        I set up work at one of these counters because it had a lot of power outlets and did my classwork (photo taken around 7 pm). 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="13.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032">
        There’s more seating (photo taken around 7 pm).

      <p>
        <img src="14.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032">
        And more seating, though I would only sit here if I was planning on just eating (photo taken around 7 pm).

        And then there’s the actual flight information for the day. My flight to Minneapolis/St. Paul is delayed (UA783 with a bunch of codeshares now departs a minute later than the last flight of the day to MSP). 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="18.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032">
        There’s a halfway decent bar hidden in the “back” of the lounge. 
      </p>

        <img src="19.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032">
        The selection up north was cleared around 7 pm, so I walked to the “main” selection down south. 
      </p>

        Here’s the QR code for list of ingredients. It was a PDF and I saved it to my phone. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="22.JPG" alt="Hot dog was ok." height="4032" width="3024">
        The hot dog isn’t quite a “Chicago Dog” but it was ok. For a better hot dog, buy one in the terminal! There’s a lot of better places in the terminal, honestly. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="23.JPG" alt="Now boarding the flight." height="894" width="783">
        <img src="24.JPG" alt="Back to the terminal!" height="3024" width="4032">
        When I got the “now boarding” notification on my phone, I went back down into the terminal, crossed the tunnel, and made my way to C28. It was 8:37 (look at the time on the upper left)
      </p>

      <p>

        Here’s my verdict. Think before spending $59 on this lounge. Do some math here. It’s not that hard. Set aside $20 (actually, less than that) for a good hot dog (with drink and fries), another $10 for a large bottle of water, and that means a little over half the price of a pass into the United Club lounge for a good meal and drink (around $30). It will probably be even less than that. Though the “privacy”, internet, and quietness are much better than down in the terminal. I submitted two homework assignments for my college class (and got full marks). Plus, the delay of my connecting flight turned a 3.5-hour layover into a 5-hour stay. So, in my case, it was actually worth the escape in the lounge. 
      </p>

      <p>

        What I wish I did was overnight in Chicago and fly the 7:30 am UA781 to MSP (it was a Boeing 737-800, but I have never flown on United’s B738 even though I have quite a few flights logged with them). Because when I landed in MSP, the drive back into Wisconsin was so tiring. Plus, I could freely change my flight with the new policy in place (which, by the way, is not pandemic-specific).
