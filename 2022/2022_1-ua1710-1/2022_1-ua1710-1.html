            <h3>Below is Post 1.</h3>
            <h2>United Airlines Boeing 737-900ER in First Class, Minneapolis to Chicago (January 2022)</h2>
           <p>
                <img src="1.JPG" alt="Tunnel from the parking lot to the terminal." height="1980" width="3520"><br>
                I arrived at the airport around an-hour-and-a-half before departure because I decided to eat outside of the airport first. I got in just before 7am for an 8am departure. <br><br>

                <img src="2.JPG" alt="New art at MSP." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                For some reason, I have never noticed this until now. Even after… many flights out of MSP… and this seems new. What was this? <br><br>

                <img src="3.JPG" alt="New Kiosks?" height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                The kiosks were also quite new, though I may have forgotten if I’ve seen them last time (in July 2021). <br><br>

                <img src="4.JPG" alt="Covid disclaimer/waiver." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                And with Omicron… Covid is still a concern for the airlines (or at least following CDC and federal government requirements). <br><br>

                <img src="5.JPG" alt="Plane at the gate in (not-so-early) morning." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                I had no intention of boarding early. I already had multiple examples of a flight on United’s Boeing 737-900ER, and I did not need more pictures. By the time I was at the gate, the flight was already halfway through boarding, so I could just stroll onto the plane. <br><br>

                <img src="6.JPG" alt="AIr Canada is back." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                But not before welcoming back Air Canada. Seems they now have their own gate E3, instead of borrowing from United’s E8. <br><br>

                <img src="7.JPG" alt="United Express CRJ200 at MSP." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                Here’s a CRJ200 stuck in Minneapolis (seems like a weather diversion, but I didn’t take a picture of the status screen). <br><br>

                <img src="8.JPG" alt="Deicing truck." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                And ICEMAN has work today. <br><br>

                <img src="9.JPG" alt="Plane at Minneapolis." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                Here’s the aircraft at MSP. The difference is I actually decided to use my camera, this time. <br><br>

                By the time we neared departure, the sun was out. <br><br>

                <img src="10.JPG" alt="Overhead PSU." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                I always appreciate these overhead air vents. They are always nice to enjoy!<br><br>

                <img src="11.JPG" alt="Snack bag." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                <img src="12.JPG" alt="Includes pretzels, stroopwafel, and water." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                For some reason, snacks were passed out before departure. <br><br>

                <img src="13.JPG" alt="Air stairs at Minneapolis." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                Also, what was the purpose of those air stairs? <br><br>

                <img src="14.JPG" alt="Pushback with a view of a Delta Flying Pencil." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                Pushback on time, and here’s a Delta Boeing 757-200.<br><br>

                <img src="15.JPG" alt="UPS Boeing 747-8F seen while taxiing to the runway." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                I’m glad I did see the Queen while taxiing to the runway for takeoff. <br><br>

                Takeoff on time with derated thrust, later increased to Climb power. <br><br>

                <img src="16.JPG" alt="Mugs and Glasses are restored!" height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                This post is mainly to describe the return of the <em> mugs and glasses!</em> Coffee is nice, but coffee is even better in an actual mug! (Same for any drink in glasses, too). <br><br>

                Landing early, and of course, I still had the “curse of the north runway” and dealt with a loooooooooooooong taxi to the gate. Whatever. <br><br>

                <img src="17.JPG" alt="Parked at the gate in Chicago." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                Here’s the plane parked at the gate. She flies to Denver next. <br><br>

                And time to go to the United Club… on the other side of the tunnel. Just because I didn’t have club cards (only one-time passes), and the only one on this side of the tunnel didn’t accept those one-time passes. <br><br>

                I’m happy mugs and glasses are back. I also heard predeparture beverage are back too (did that snack bag count?) because I always enjoy getting a drink before departure. This being said, I had CPU upgrades, so I’ll enjoy it as much as I can, for as long as I can. If sitting in Economy, I’ll bring a bottle of water. <br><br>

                Honestly, I’m just glad to sit in First Class for the short hop. This was a CPU upgrade, so I’m appreciative of getting to sit up front. That’s all I’ll say. <br><br>

                And now, off to the <a href="../2022_2-uaclubb8-1/2022_2-uaclubb8-1.html">lounge</a> for the long layover<br>
