            <h2>Two Planes, Two Seats, Two Flights: United Boeing 787-9 in First (Polaris and Diamond)</h2>
            <p>
                I have no clue how I managed to clear two CPU upgrades on a route like Chicago to LA. This is probably one of the more “elite-heavy” routes. American and United each have hubs at both ends, Delta doesn’t serve this route (as of the time of flight), Alaska only has a hub at LA, and Spirit only has a focus city in Chicago, so some might think that the number of elites would be more distributed than, say, Chicago to San Francisco. Maybe.  <br><br>

                <img src="img/1.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                Both of my flights will be flown by planes in the old paint, but in different interior configurations. <br><br>

                <img src="img/2.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                Here’s the gate area. <br><br>

                <img src="img/3.JPG" alt="text." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                I like this new signage. <br><br>

                <img src="img/4.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                This… not so much. <br><br>

                <img src="img/5.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                I was directed to go through L1, and so I got a look at the forward “Polaris” cabin…<br><br>

                <img src="img/6.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                And rear “Polaris” cabin. <br><br>

                <img src="img/7.JPG" alt="text." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                I had seat 10A, which is what I was given when my CPU cleared. I’m just glad it cleared. <br><br>

                <img src="img/8.JPG" alt="text." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                Predeparture beverage choices were water or some other alcoholic option (I think it was sparkling wine). I had water. <br><br>

                <img src="img/9.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                I did take a bathroom visit before departure. Note the toiletries (like the lotion).<br><br>

                <img src="img/10.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                And thankfully, there were two overhead air vents! <br><br>

                <img src="img/11.JPG" alt="text." height="1980" width="3520"><br>
                Here’s a repainted Boeing 777-200ER going to San Francisco. <br><br>

                I put “Polaris” in quotation marks because this plane, while it had the new Polaris Business Class seats, was flying a domestic flight, so domestic First Class service was available. Only while flying on an intercontinental flight (or internationally) would legitimate Polaris Business Class service be available. <br><br>

                <img src="img/12.PNG" alt="text." height="1792" width="828"><br>
                Even though we departed a bit late (I noticed ground crew in neon yellow vests getting on the plane and walking off with bags of blankets that seemed to be used), we’d arrive a bit early. Not that it mattered much. <br><br>

                <img src="img/13.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                I did make another bathroom visit just to wash my hands. The sink is automatically activated and there are still some toiletries (like lotion) available even though this flight is domestic. <br><br>

                <img src="img/14.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                The toilet does have the smart “close the lid and flush” available. <br><br>

                <img src="img/15.PNG" alt="text." height="1792" width="828"><br>
                Apparently, this is a “Lunch” flight. I didn’t remember that United restored full meals a while back to their longer hub-to-hub flights. <br><br>

                <img src="img/16.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                Today’s options were some “Southwestern Chicken with Rice” or “Ragu Polenta” (I don’t remember the second one). Both are served with a warm “Pie in the Sky”, warm roll, butter, and fruit. <br><br>

                <img src="img/17.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                I had the chicken with rice option. I thought it was bland, so I added salt. <br><br>

                <img src="img/18.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                The person across the aisle had the ragu option, I asked if I could photograph it. He gladly did so. <br><br>

                <img src="img/19.JPG" alt="text." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                Of course, silverware is restored! <br><br>

                <img src="img/20.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                Here’s the view from my seat. <br><br>

                <img src="img/21.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                Seat controls are… yeah, I didn’t like them. It’s placed in a position where I could easily accidentally bump into them. More on that later. <br><br>

                <img src="img/22.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                As with the other “Polaris” flight that I took, there was a faux lamp that didn’t seem to be very bright. <br><br>

                <img src="img/23.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                Anytime there’s a remote, I’d use it. I don’t know, it just gives me a bit of a… “I’m in a lounge chair watching TV at home” feel. Near it is a 110V AC outlet, USB-A port, and (two) headphone plugs. <br><br>

                <img src="img/24.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                The windows can be dimmed on the IFE screen, or on the window dimmer below the window. I’d rather have shades…<br><br>

                <img src="img/25.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                The armrest can be lowered, which is definitely helpful for my seat! <br><br>

                <img src="img/26.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                The default position is raised, though. <br><br>

                <img src="img/27.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                A 15.6-inch screen (I think) is the IFE for today’s flight. <br><br>

                <img src="img/28.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                Or you could use a tablet, which you could place on the provided tablet holder. <br><br>

                <img src="img/29.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                Which, by the way, is built in the tray. <br><br>

                <img src="img/30.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                Here’s the seat when it’s lie-flat. I can attest that it felt narrow. <br><br>

                <img src="img/31.PNG" alt="text." height="1792" width="828"><br>
                Little secret: even though I only activated the text messaging plan for the onboard internet, I was able to access other apps and sites (like Flightradar24). I spent some time connecting with my friends on the ground on social media (like Snapchat and Instagram). For those who use TikTok, the internet was only fast enough to load a few videos, then it started buffering. <br><br>

                <img src="img/32.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                Annoyingly, the lights were never shut off. It remained in this little “orange/sunset” option. <br><br>

                <img src="img/33.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                And the footwell. Gosh, those were narrow! I wear size 10 shoes, and I only had a bit extra space in there. <br><br>

                <img src="img/34.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                Here’s the view of my seat going forward. <br><br>

                <img src="img/35.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                And here’s the view from my seat. <br><br>

                <img src="img/36.JPG" alt="text." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                The view out of the window is obstructed by this giant engine. <br><br>

                There weren’t any blankets available (I asked), so I used my winter coat as a blanket and took a 30-minute power nap. I don’t think this had anything to do with the delay earlier today (given they were removing used blankets from the plane, or at least that’s what I thought). <br><br>

                <img src="img/37.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                Only just before landing do they decide to turn the lights down to a dark blue. <br><br>

                <img src="img/38.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                While walking to a lounge, I saw the theme building. <br><br>

                <img src="img/39.JPG" alt="text." height="3072" width="4608"><br>
                Here’s a Boeing 737-900ER going to Chicago. Probably one of the more common aircrafts found on this route with United. <br><br>

                <img src="img/40.JPG" alt="text." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                Crossing the jetbridge on the return flight. <br><br>

                <img src="img/41.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                Here’s the older layout. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the opportunity to photograph the forward cabin. A week after my flight, this plane was sent to get the new Polaris seats installed (and these old seats were removed). <br><br>

                <img src="img/42.JPG" alt="text." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                View from my seat. I had Seat 7L, so I got a whole wing view…<br><br>

                <img src="img/43.JPG" alt="text." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                Which seemed to be covered up due to the paint issues. I asked the FA about this, and the crew called a mechanic onboard. I asked him why there was so much speed tape on this plane. He told me that this plane had peeling paint issues, which is why speed tape was used. <br><br>

                <img src="img/44.JPG" alt="text." height="4032" width="3024"><br>
                Honestly, I think the diamond seat footwell is a lot smaller. But the padding is good, though. <br><br>

                <img src="img/45.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                This will be missed on the new seats: the little cubby for your shoes. <br><br>

                <img src="img/46.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                The seat controls were nice. Fewer controls than the old seat. Although there were presets for fully flat and fully upright seats. <br><br>

                <img src="img/47.JPG" alt="text." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                Blankets were provided, though I didn’t get a picture until the next flight (which had the same blankets). <br><br>

                I didn’t get a picture of the remote, but this plane used a newer remote system that was supposedly touchscreen. It was buggy, so I could see why United opted for an older remote. I also noticed that the IFE used the older interface (which was the one I was used to seeing before the pandemic). <br><br>

                <img src="img/48.PNG" alt="text." height="1792" width="828"><br>
                The internet also had the older interface, which was the one I was used to seeing before the pandemic. <br><br>

                <img src="img/49.PNG" alt="text." height="1792" width="828"><br>
                <img src="img/50.PNG" alt="text." height="1792" width="828"><br>
                Messaging is also available on this flight, and as with the previous flight to LA, I was able to use the entire internet with a few caveats (mostly with streaming). Even though it said that "web surfing" was not available. <br><br>

                <img src="img/51.PNG" alt="text." height="1792" width="828"><br>
                United now uses FlightAware as the map that they show in the app. Without selecting an internet plan, this is also one of the websites that United allows you to use. You can see that we’re flying at a really high altitude at a really fast speed (FL410 at 620 miles per hour!). <br><br>

                <img src="img/52.PNG" alt="text." height="1792" width="828"><br>
                And of course, other flight information. <br><br>

                We landed early, and it was off to the next flight. My seatmate didn’t put his seat up until we were on final. I skipped the meal, but I heard that the options were the same on the previous flight. I ate in the lounge anyways and wanted to maximize sleep on this flight. <br><br>

                I am impressed by the professionalism shown by the crew and staff on United. When I raised a concern that was probably a mild annoyance, they brought a professional onboard (a mechanic) who explained to me, in great detail, why this wing was patched up. Admittedly, I was more alarmed that there was this much speed tape on board. But the mechanic’s explanation was very detailed and he spoke in a calming voice that I was perfectly fine with taking this flight (I considered offloading myself for a brief moment). It’s things like these that will keep me flying with United for a long time, and it’s things like these that make me more confident in their safety. I will continue to pick what is best for me, but I know that United is a great carrier that I will continue to earn miles on and that I will continue to fly with. <br><br>

                I enjoyed both of my flights. It was a great way to spend time away from home for a bit. The hot meal is something that I am glad to see restored. Hot meals were restored to more flights just before the second half of the year. I also enjoyed both seats. Personally, I am content with both seats. Even though I had a seat closer to the aisle on the “Polaris” leg (which was, frankly, facing the aisle), I thought that the privacy was decent, especially with the (lack of) traffic. Regardless, I would’ve stood in the aisle to get the photo of the reclined seat. <br><br>

                I did think the seat was a bit on the narrow side, even though the privacy was nice. To be fair, there are some narrow seats out there, but if you're of a larger size, look for a flight operated by the Boeing 777. <br><br>
