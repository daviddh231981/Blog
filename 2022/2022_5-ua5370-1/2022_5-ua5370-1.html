                After getting some sleep and changing into different pants (because it's freezing), I went across the concourse to my gate, from B17 to B1. Thank goodness for boarding notifications!<br><br>

                <img src="2.JPG" alt="First class cabin, starboard side." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                I had a first class seat in the first class cabin. Unfortunately, since boarding was rushed and I was extremely exhausted, I only got this photo. <br><br>

                <img src="3.JPG" alt="Blanket is offered." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                I'm so thankful that a blanket was offered, especially since I wanted to sleep. I fell asleep roughly a few minutes after takeoff.<br><br>

                <img src="4.JPG" alt="Legroom is decent enough." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                Legroom is decent enough for me.<br><br>

                <img src="5.JPG" alt="Amazing sunrise on takeoff." height="3024" width="4032"><br>
                And of course, an amazing sunrise on takeoff.<br><br>

                No Predeparture Beverage was offered today, but whatever. I was a bit annoyed, though, since I would've liked to have a coffee before it kicked in for the day. But one shouldn't really rely on inflight food and beverage. Still doesn't make it any better, though.<br><br>

                We landed early, and I made a beeline to the parking lot. Screenshot from the United App.<br><br>

                By the time that scheduled arrival time rolled around, I was off airport property and well on the drive home.<br><br>
